	<h2><a id='sec1'>1 </a> Introduction</h2>
		The cREST Client extension is an http client with RESTful services in mind. The UI is divided into three high level sections including
		<ul>
			<li>Request Builder for constructing http requests</li>
			<li>Responses for viewing/managing http responses</li>
			<li>Request Store for viewing/editing your stored request data. This data includes saved requests, URI history, and header history.</li>
		</ul>
		Please feel free to speak up in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/crest-client" target="_blank">http://groups.google.com/group/crest-client</a>
		 if you have questions/comments about the extension. Also 
		let me know if there's anything I can do to make this help page more useful.
	<h2><a id='sec2'>2 </a> Request Builder</h2>
	<p>
		The request builder contains all the ui components you need in order to submit an http request. This is where you can specify a URI, select 
		your http method, add any headers, or include a request entity for PUT/POST requests. The remainder of section 2 will describe some of the 
		more notable components in the Request Builder. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/crest-client" target="_blank">Let me know</a> if you&#039;d like anything else covered.
	</p>
	<h3><a id='sec2'>2.1 </a> URI/Header Auto-complete</h3>
	<p>
		The autocomplete fields for URIs and headers will suggest options that it finds in your URI history, header history, or 
		your saved requests. The URI and header history both get populated each time you use a new URI or header in a successful 
		request. In addition, you can manually edit the URI/header history by clicking the pencil button next to the 
		coorisponding autocomplete field. You can also get to your URI/header history from the request store button discussed below.
	</p>
	<p>
		Saved requests will be covered in more detail <a href="#">TODO: below</a>. Know that if you select one from 
		the URI autocomplete dropdown list, it will populate the request builder with all of its data. This includes URI,
		method, and any headers or request entity that may be present.
		If you select a saved request from the header autocomplete dropdown, it will load all of that request's headers.
		Saved requests are named by you, so you should be able
		to easily distinguish them from your URIs and headers in the autocomplete suggestions.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Items for the autocomplete dropdown are selected in a case insensitive way. The suggested
		items only need to contain the <i>term</i> you've typed, not start with it. In addition, 
		you can specify multiple terms by separating them with a space. This comes in handy when you
		have many URIs that only differ by a little. 
	</p>
	<h3><a id='sec2'>2.1 </a> Saved Requests</h3>
	<p>
		cREST lets you save requests for re-use later. Each response has a save button (disk icon) that allows you 
		to save the request that produced the response. When clicked, the request editor will be launched so you 
		can make some changes (typically giving it a better name), and then save the request. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Once the request is saved, it can be used to populate fields within the Request Builder. As previously 
		mentioned, the names of your saved requests will show up in the URI and header autocomplete suggestions 
		and when selected will populate corresponding Request Builder fields. There is also a new home button on 
		the Request Builder tool bar. You can associate one of your saved request with it so that when it's 
		clicked, the request will be loaded. Specifying this request is done with the "request store" covered in 
		the next section.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that these requests don't necessarily need to represent a valid http request. You might create one 
		that only has commonly used headers with no URI or request method.	
	</p>

	<h3><a id='sec2'>2.1 </a> Request Store</h3>
	<p>
		You can access/edit your stored data by clicking the folder icon. Three kinds of data are saved, each with their own tab:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Saved Requests
				<p>
					This tab allows you to manage your saved requests. The first row indicates which request is associated with 
					your home button. By default, cREST associates a request with no URI, headers, or entity and a GET request method.
					Next you'll see your saved requests if you have any. They are ordered alphabetically. Each request has the 
					following buttons (from left to right):
					<ol>
						<li>
							Play - The saved request will be loaded into the Request Builder and a request will be submitted. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Up Array - This loads the request in the Request Builder. Double clicking the request outside of the buttons also does this. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Home      - Sets the request to your home button. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Copy       - This allows you to copy the request. It will display the request editor with a new name which can be modified before you save. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Edit         - This allows you to edit the request. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Trash       - deletes the saved request. 
						</li>
					</ol>			
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				URI History 
				<p>
					These are all the URIs you've targeted that have returned successful responses. This tab displays a textarea for you 
					to manually edit your URIs. These URIs are used for the URI autocomplete suggestions.
				</p>				
			</li>
			<li>
				Header History 
				<p>
					This tab is identical to the URI history, only it's for your headers and the header autocomplete.				
				</p>				
			</li>
		</ol>
