	<h2><a id='sec1'>1 </a> Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		The cREST Client extension is an http client with RESTful services in mind. The UI is 
		divided into two high level sections including the Request Builder, and Responses. The 
		Request Builder includes sections for specifying a URI, an HTTP method, headers, and a 
		request entity. The Responses section is where information about your http responses 
		are kept including some useful features that help you manage them.
		
		Big thanks to the jQuery for a cool api.
	</p>
	<p>	
		Please feel free to speak up in 
		<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/crest-client">http://groups.google.com/group/crest-client</a>
		if you have questions/comments about the extension. Also let me know if there's anything I can do to 
		make this help page more useful.
	</p>
	
	<h2><a id='sec2'>2 </a> Request Builder</h2>
	<p>
		The request builder contains all the ui components you need in order to submit an http request. This is where you
		can specify a URI, select your http method, add any headers, or include a request entity for PUT/POST requests.
		
		The following sections will outline some of the more notable Request Builder fields/buttons. 
	</p>
	<h3><a id='sec2'>2.1 </a> URI/Header Auto-complete</h3>
	<p>
		The autocomplete fields for URIs and headers will suggest options that it finds in your URI history, header history, or 
		your saved requests. The URI and header history both get populated each time you use a new URI or header in a successful 
		request. In addition, you can manually edit the URI/header history by clicking the pencil button next to the 
		coorisponding autocomplete field. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Saved requests will be covered in more detail <a href="#">TODO: HERE</a>. Know that if you select one from 
		the URI autocomplete dropdown list, it will populate the request builder with all of its data. This includes URI,
		method, and any headers or request entity that may be present.
		If you select a saved request from the header autocomplete dropdown, it will load all of that request's headers.
		Saved requests are named by you, so you should be able
		to distinguish them from your URIs/headers in the autocomplete suggestions.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Items for the autocomplete dropdown are selected in a case insensitive way. The suggested
		items only need to contain the <i>term</i> you've typed, not start with it. In addition, 
		you can specify multiple terms by separating them with a space. This comes in handy when you
		have many URIs that only differ by a little. 
	</p>
	<h3><a id='sec2'>2.1 </a> Saved Requests</h3>
	<p>
		cREST now lets you save your request for re-use later. Before you can save your first request, you'll
		need to submit one. In the toolbar of the response, you'll see a little disk icon with the "save request"
		tooltip. This button will launch the request editor where you can make some changes (typically giving it a 
		better name), and then save the request in the Req Store.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		After you've saved a request, you can do some handy things with it. As previously mentioned, the name of your
		saved requests will show up in the URI and header autocomplete suggestions. You can also click the Req Store
		button for more options. The first play button will load the request in the Request Builder and run it. The 
		second button (arrow) will only load the request in the Request Builder. The last two buttons are used to 
		copy/edit a request anyway you see fit.
		<br/><br/>
		Consider the properties of a saved request:
		<br/><br/>
		Name<br/>
		Method<br/>
		URI<br/>
		Headers<br/>
		Entity<br/>
		<br/>
