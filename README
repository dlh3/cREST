cREST is RESTful service client chrome extension.

The source for the extension is bundled into a maven JEE
project and can be found in src/main/webapp/ext. The maven
project is a Jersey based RESTful service that is used to
easily test the extension.

If you'd like to get the project setup the way i did, ensure you 
have eclipse helios with WTP, and maven. 

mvn eclipse:eclipse - this will create your eclipse project so you
can import it. 

mvn jetty:run - this will run the RESTful test service so you can
easily test the plugin.
